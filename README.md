## Motivation
I didn't fancy the available free solutions and was't inclined to pay for them. Instead, I embarked on developing an app primarily driven by the desire for both fun and learning.
Through this process, I aimed to craft an application that not only fulfilled my requirements but also served as a platform for learning features of the new Flutter version.
